          </div>

          <h1>Non-government Organizations</h1>

          <p>
            NGO’s are known for their strife to make the world a better place and branch out into an array of subjects. There are many geographers who go on to work for these companies and do great work including protecting the environment, protecting animals, and protecting human rights. Job opportunities range from research to analysis to working on action plans for countries in need of assistance. Some of the better known organizations are the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). The WHO is the health arm of the United Nations (another great NGO to work for) and role is to direct and coordinate international health including areas of improving health systems, noncommunicable/communicable diseases, and preparedness, surveillance and response. The WWF is one of the world’s leading conservation organizations and is proud of both its local and global efforts.

          <h1>Natural Resources</h1>
          <p>
            In the natural resources sector there are many job opportunities for geographers, especially geographic information systems analysts. Many energy companies have opened new positions for GIS technicians in order to tap into the power that is GIS technologies. These companies seek employers to see how they can better utilize GISciences in all parts of their network and business operations. There are many jobs and careers for geographers, locally there is Florida Power and Light which is a part of Next Era energy and on a more global scale Shell Oil.

          <h1>Academia</h1>
          <img src="img/academic.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 1em auto;">
          <p>
            Many geographers return to academia after the excitement of traveling the world has died down. Professors teach the future generation of geogaphers as well as continue with work they think is relevant and helpful to their branch of geography. With an extensive collection of universities in the United States, academics don’t have a hard time finding a place that fits right for them. Geography is slowly making its comeback as a crucial subject area at universities; many universities are adopting GISciences technology and are strongly encouraging its use with its geography majors and beyond. Some of the top geography programs in the United States are found at Dartmouth College, University of California Berkeley, and Georgia State University.
          </p>

          <h1>Government Organizations</h1>
          <img src="img/gov.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 1em auto;">

          <p>
            As GISciences technologies and application are more affordable and available government agencies are becoming more interested in the programs and how they can use it to their advantage. Many agencies use GIS technicians to convert data to a visual representation or map and to run spatial analysis on the requirements for a new development. You can find geographers, not only in the field of GIS but city management, public works, public health parks department and beyond. Geographers can work for the local government to the national government across all sectors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Geographers working for government agencies are spread across many sectors. Medical geographers could be working for the center for disease control for their state government and use GIS technologies to track and isolate a potential threat like the Bird Flu. Environmental geographers can be used in environmental management to determine the extent and timing of a prescribed burn. Like the private sector, the public sector is full of opportunities for geographers at all levels and with all specialties.

          <h1>The <i>Real World</i></h1>

          <h2>1.What's a typical day look like for you?</h2>
          <p>
            From Monday to Friday 7:30am to 4:30pm work as GIS coordinator for FDOT at District Six.  Fists thing in the morning is to make sure all GIS district's we base application are up and running. Review the Log files, the "Log files" are Python prints with the results of all data loads performed at night to update our enterprise geodatabase. If something when wrong fixed by myself or assign a task to the GIS developer or GIS analyst so they take care of it. Depending on the day I will be assigning task to my two consultants, review working progress report, creating map services, replicating databases, setup GIS website applications, attending meetings, helping other people using GIS and coordinating new GIS data developments and data creation with other departments. Depending on the semester I will be teaching Intro to GIS at UM one or two days a week from 5pm to 7pm approximately. So it could be a long day working at FDOT District Six and teaching at UM.
          </p>

          <h2>2. How did you get into this field? Did you envision this career when you were in university?</h2>
          <p>
          I like the natural environment, maps and traveling so I did my bachelor in Physic Geography but there was not such a thing as GIS when I graduated back in Cuba in 1984. As a geographer I was working on environmental management programs such as soil conservation, reforestation and watershed management. Later on the nineties I get interested in GIS and have the opportunity of complete a Master in Environmental Science as well as a Graduated Certificate in GIS. I start using GIS and RS for environmental management working at FIU probably 10 years ago and later for the environmental department at FDOT District six and finally like four years ago I become the District GIS coordinator and dedicate myself full time to GIS.
          </p>

          <h2>3. What's the benefit of working both as a professional and as an educator?</h2>
          <p>
          It is a great benefit because I take to my class my day to day experiences with GIS. I can show my students real examples of applications, scripts, GIS analysis and solutions that are being used to maintain a live GIS enterprise.  Even some times find potential solutions to real GIS problems that I am facing by discussing GIS issues with my students which is really amazing for me.
          </p>

          <h2>4. How does the difference between geographic theory and practice affect you?</h2>
          <p>
          It doesn't affect me. I think theory and practice should go together. You have to be up-to-date with theory and have a good hands on experience. You won't make too much money in GIS if you don't have a solid theory background. For instance about geographic projections (geometry), spatial analysis (statistics), network (graph theory), etc.
