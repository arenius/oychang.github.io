                          <p>Charles Darwin (1809-188) was a naturalist and geologist who developed the theories of natural selection and the biological theory of evolution. These theories have influenced the science of geography throughout time and still has a role today. Natural selection and evolution tie together time and space because it involves the adaptation over time of an organism to its surroundings. He was deemed to be an environmental determinist which is someone who believes attributes of an organism are due to its environment.</p>

                          <p>Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) was a German philosopher and scientist who established a firm basis for factual knowledge, in particular the scientific method. Kant is known as one of history’s great thinkers having influence in a wide range of subjects like mathematics, geography and anthropology. His works questioned the traditional approach to knowledge and developed what he calls the transcendental approach which is an investigation into deductive reasoning. Kant was also an influential professor teaching a range of subjects, among his popular courses was geography. In his writings, Kant describes the development of space from place. He continues to describe that there is always place (there is always a distance between two place on a map) but a space is a mental construct of human experience. Kant’s influence on geography is still see today and changed the idea of empirical thinking.

                          <p>
                            Alexander Von Humboldt (1769-1859) was a scientific traveler who was searching for the universal patterns underlying phenomena. Humboldt viewed nature holistically and felt that nature was an interrelation of all physical sciences. He traveled the world for many years and took accounts of the places he visited and the areas he studied. Later in life Humboldt wrote Kosmos which was a sketch of a physical description of the universe.

                          <p>
                            Along with Humboldt, Carl Ritter is commonly associated as the founders of geography. He was a German geographer and taught his views of geography at the University of Berlin until the end of his life. Like Kant, Ritter saw geography as an empirical science and expressed the presence and importance of the laws of geography. His great work, “Earth Science in Relation to Nature and the History of Man,” was intended as a world survey but was never completed and was halted by an early death at nineteen volumes.
