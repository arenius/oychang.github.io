                          <p>Charles Darwin (1809-188) was a naturalist and geologist who developed the theories of natural selection and the biological theory of evolution. These theories have influenced the science of geography throughout time and still has a role today. Natural selection and evolution tie together time and space because it involves the adaptation over time of an organism to its surroundings. He was deemed to be an environmental determinist which is someone who believes attributes of an organism are due to its environment.</p>

                          <p>Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) was a German philosopher and scientist who established a firm basis for factual knowledge, in particular the scientific method. Kant is known as one of history’s great thinkers having influence in a wide range of subjects like mathematics, geography and anthropology. His works questioned the traditional approach to knowledge and developed what he calls the transcendental approach which is an investigation into deductive reasoning. Kant was also an influential professor teaching a range of subjects, among his popular courses was geography. In his writings, Kant describes the development of space from place. He continues to describe that there is always place (there is always a distance between two place on a map) but a space is a mental construct of human experience. Kant’s influence on geography is still see today and changed the idea of empirical thinking.

The Geographer is eight volumes in length and discussed topics like representing a spherical world on a flat sheet of paper (map projections), placing a grid system on a map for the entire world and a collection of maps using coordinate systems.

Best known as the first person to calculate the circumference of the Earth as well as the tilt of the Earth’s axis, and the distance from the Earth to the sun. Also known as the ‘father of geography,’ Eratosthenes was known as the creator of the discipline of geography and his published work, Geography where he described and mapped his entire known world. In this three-volume work he created terminology still used today, divided the Earth into five climate zones, and used grids of overlapping lines and used parallels and meridians to link together places in the world.

                            Alexander Von Humboldt (1769-1859) was a scientific traveler who was searching for the universal patterns underlying phenomena. Humboldt viewed nature holistically and felt that nature was an interrelation of all physical sciences. He traveled the world for many years and took accounts of the places he visited and the areas he studied. Later in life Humboldt wrote Kosmos which was a sketch of a physical description of the universe.

                            Along with Humboldt, Carl Ritter is commonly associated as the founders of geography. He was a German geographer and taught his views of geography at the University of Berlin until the end of his life. Like Kant, Ritter saw geography as an empirical science and expressed the presence and importance of the laws of geography. His great work, “Earth Science in Relation to Nature and the History of Man,” was intended as a world survey but was never completed and was halted by an early death at nineteen volumes.

                            Paul Vidal de La Blache is a French geographer who has profound influence on modern geography and can be attributed as the founder of human geography. He challenged the theory of environmental determinism and believed that humans were not confined by their environment but instead environment created opportunity (Genre de vie). This pushed the shift of thinking from environmental determinism to possiblism.

                            John K Wright an important leader of the American Geographical Society and in his address as president he defined the term geosophy which is the definition we use today. He described it as encompassing the study of geography from any or all points of view. In his works he further describes the overlapping of academic disciplines in geography, the power of the mind in creating subjectivity in geographic research and the importance of sharing knowledge.

                            Carl Sauer graduated from the University of Chicago and began to teacher geography at the University of Michigan and later at the University of California Berkeley. His works and teachings make up the “Berkeley School” of geographic thought with focus on regional geography based on culture, landscapers and history. His work “The Morphology of Landscape” in 1925 challenged environmental determinism and made his stance that geography should be the study of how present landscapes were shaped over time by people and natural processes.
