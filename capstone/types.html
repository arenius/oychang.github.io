                        <h3>“The Regional concept constitutes the core of geography.”
                          <small>–James (1929:195)</small>
                        </h3>

                        <p>Throughout history regional geography has traditionally been largely descriptive in order to explain and show how regions are different and how a person’s geography determines development. Thinking about Darwin’s theories of evolution and natural selection it can be seen how important geography has been in the development humans physically and culturally. Regional geography has helped to compare and contrast societies in relation to their time and place in space. Another way to look at regional geography is through the view of possibilism where people do things because of nature but because of their way of life. This idea can be seen through the works of a popular influence on regional geography, Paul de La Blache who is best known for his account of regional geography of France.</p>
                        <p>Regional geography is used to describe the differences between places due to their geography. Physical geography and cultural geography have been infused with regional geography since the beginning of time. Regional geography helps to show how different places have developed differently through time due to the difference in physical and cultural geography. Today regional geography has taken a large shift from the descriptive to the empirical in analyzing the difference between people, places and their history.</p>
                        <p>A major which has always faces regional geography and geographers like Vidal de La Blache is the concept of a region. As a concept, region is denotes an area of an indeterminate size that is itself part of a larger whole and includes smaller units within it. Thinking about and define a region can be vague and confusing because a region is developed through perception. A region can extend beyond several countries as well as across a few blocks. For example the continent of Europe is a region in terms of the world but Brooklyn is a part of New York. The vagueness and in-betweenness of regional geography makes it an ever-changing and interesting area of study because of its many sub disicplines within the study.</p>

                      <p>The basic definition of political geography is the study of how politics is informed by geography. For a long time political geography was used to show how physical features of the Earth affected the ways in which humans divided the world up into political units and how these units competed with one another for power and influences. This study began around 1759 when Turgot first coined the term political geography and the study of underlying forces which shape our will drove political sciences. Political geography stemmed from regional geography in that it is based on natural divisions and was devoted to showing how social and natural features affected the development of a state.</p>
                      <p>Through political geography we have learned that politics is always about something else when we talk about the physical and economic determinist views. As times have changed so has reasoning and pursuits of a state which has led to an alternative way of thinking about political geography: how geography is informed by politics. Politics is important to geography and this transformation in that it extended the spaces of domination, traces lines of exclusion, creates internal and external boarders, determines centers and peripheries, and spaces of production and consumption.</p>
                      <p>Political geography is used today to help develop boundaries and provide insight on how the past decisions of politicians and leaders has formed the political world of today. At a household level political geography is used in elections and the explanation of why certain laws are enacted in one place rather than another. On a global scale, geography can be seen in the developing world where boundaries are not exact and how places like Ukraine are forever tied to Russia through their history with the Soviet Union.</p>

                      <p>Environmental geography focuses on the relationships between human and natural systems. Furthermore, it is the relationships between an organism, its environment and the things within it which consist of many flows and network that help to determine the path of the relationship. Through studies in environmental geographies it has helped to explain why and how cultures and the environment change. Environmental geography overlaps into political, cultural and historical geography.</p>
                      <p>With the industrial revolution and technological advancement, the human capability to alter their environment to better suit its development have become almost unlimited. Therefore humans have further impacted their environment and must deal with the repercussions of altering the natural systems of environment.</p>
  	                  <p>As humans become more conscious of the environment and how society has impacted it, and vice versa. Today environmental geography expands into the concept of ecology which has opened the door to exploring sub disciplines of systems ecology and adaptive management. A very important issue environmental geographers deal with today is coastal management and addressing the ever present issue of sea-level rise.</p>

                        <p>Medical geography, the geography of disease, has been used dated back to the times of yellow fever and the plague. Disease is influenced by geographical factors including physical, social and biological. Physical geographic factors are climate, soil, and more; the social geographical factors include population density, standards of living and more; and lastly the biological geographic factors are animal life, dominant blood groups, vegetation and more. In the past, physicians have been focused on the symptoms of disease but with further advancements in medical technology attention has turned to the biochemical disorders that are a result of disease.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 1em;">This new approach to medical geography recognizes that disease is a multiple phenomenon which encompasses the relationship between the various factors of this complex and their geographic environments. The integration of GIS (geographic information systems) has even further developed the study of medical geography allowing for visual representation of the geography of disease. By using spatial analysis disease can be traced to source, hot spots can be identified, and it can be easier to contain. In the future we can hope to see the full potential of GIS in the study of medical geography when environmental and disease surveillance systems are able to distribute the geography of environmental conditions, disease agents, and health outcomes over time. The development of disease through time will help to further containment and avoid the outbreak of disease.</p>
