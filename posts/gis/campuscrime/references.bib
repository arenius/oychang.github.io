abstract ={
In the late 1980s, celebrated victimizations of college students and grassroots efforts by victims and their families prompted Congress to pass the Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act of 1990 that requires postsecondary institutions to disseminate crime statistics for their campuses annually. Using data from a victimization study of more than 3,400 college students, the authors examine whether statistics generated by this policy initiative provide an accurate portrait of on-campus crime. Results of their analyses cast serious doubt on the validity and reliability of the statistics generated by the act.

abstract = {A few violent campus incidents highlighted by the media have drawn a spotlight to college and university campuses that has created the impression that campuses are increasingly dangerous places. This article discusses the legal, legislative, and administrative responses to victimization and fear on campuses and critically examines issues raised by these responses and the media. Several court decisions have addressed issues concerning university liability to student victims of campus crime and have used the doctrine of foreseeability as the standard for establishing liability. Congress responded by passing the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990, which mandates postsecondary schools to publicly report certain crime statistics and security policies. Several state legislatures have also enacted reporting legislation. Further, administrators have begun to implement a variety of educational crime prevention and safety programs, as well as security procedures, to reduce crime, risk, and fear.},
